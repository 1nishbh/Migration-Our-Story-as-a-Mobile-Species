**Migration** seems to be ingrained in the blueprint of our existence. From the dawn of our species, humans have migrated from Africa to Asia to Eurasia to America. Early ancestors moved from places to places in search of better habitats and food. Migration not only ensured the survival of our species through suitable climate and food but also changed the behaviors and lifestyle of our species as a whole. The hunter-gatherers tribe settled into agricultural soci- eties, and there are several other revolutionary transformations to the structures of our society that can be ascribed to migrationâ€“rise and fall of kingdoms, industrial revolution, displace- ment of indigenous population, changes in the population characteristics (gender, religion, age groups), to mention some.

While the nature of migration and its consequences have changed along with times, it is important that the patterns of migration are scrutinized to understand the socioeconomic drivers of migration. This project will study the mobility of human from different countries across two different decades, 2000-2010 and 2010-2020. As stated before, humans have always been mobile species, but the motives have evolved over time. So it will also be equally important to shed light on the driving forces of migration, rather than bluntly mentioning the statistics. In order to achieve this aim, this project will look migration patterns through the lenses of economy, war, epidemics, and human rights.

# Data Collection

The datasets that will be used to study the migration dynamics will be obtained from "Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)" and "The Global Knowledge Partnership on Migration and Development (KNOMAD)".
The [dataset](https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=MIG) from OECD will contain the migration rate--record as the number of individuals migrating from one country to another--across 2000-2022 where as [KNOMAD's datasets](https://www.knomad.org/data/remittances) will contain the capital outflows from and inflows of a specific country.

The OECD dataset has measures of inflows and outflows of foreign population for a country. The measures are based on population registers, residence and/or work permits, and estimation from surveys.

The general view of the the data in OECD dataset is shown in @fig-polar.

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import plotly.express as px
import plotly.io as pio
flows = pd.read_csv("../data/inflows of foreign population by nationality.csv", low_memory=False)
# dropping the total migrants value for belgium for 2010.
flows = flows.dropna(subset=['Value'])
flows_cleaned = flows.dropna(subset=['Value'])

# dropping columns that we don't need
flows_cleaned = flows.drop(columns=['Flag Codes', 'Flags'])
flows_cleaned.head()
```

The remittance data looks like the following @fig-polar
```{python}
import pandas as pd
remitance = pd.read_excel("../data/outward-remittance-flows-brief-39-december-2023-revised-as-of-mar.8-2024_1.xlsx", header = 1, index_col= None)
remitance = remitance.dropna()
remitance.head()
```

**Welcome** to *my* ~~super~~ SUPER awesome `blog` post!

## Quarto is cool

This section was copy/pasted from various parts of the [Quarto website](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/vscode.html).

:::{.callout-note}
Note that there are five types of callouts, including:
`note`, `tip`, `warning`, `caution`, and `important`.

:::{.callout-tip}
## Tip With Caption

This is an example of a callout with a caption.

For your reference, here's an example of a Python code cell in Quarto, along with a figure that gets generated, along with a caption and a label so that it can be referred to automatically as "Figure 1" (or whatever) in the writeup.

For a demonstration of a line plot on a polar axis, see @fig-polar.

```{python}
#| label: fig-polar
#| fig-cap: "A line plot on a polar axis"

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

r = np.arange(0, 2, 0.01)
theta = 2 * np.pi * r
fig, ax = plt.subplots(
  subplot_kw = {'projection': 'polar'} 
)
ax.plot(theta, r)
ax.set_rticks([0.5, 1, 1.5, 2])
ax.grid(True)
plt.show()
```
