## Project Overview
The Migration Data Analysis project aims to provide a comprehensive set of tools and analyses for understanding migration patterns, employment trends, sentiment towards migration, and other related topics.

It includes various notebooks that cover tasks such as clustering, forecasting, nationality acquisition, remittance analysis, and more.

## Installation

To run the notebooks and scripts in this repository, you need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed on your system. Additionally, you may need to install specific Python packages depending on the requirements of each notebook or script.

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/nishbh01/Migration-Our-Story-as-a-Mobile-Species.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd migration-data-analysis
```
or open mannually in your editor. 

## Usage
Each Jupyter Notebook in this repository serves a different purpose. You can explore and run them individually based on your specific needs. (For example, to run the classification.ipynb notebook, open it in Jupyter Notebook and execute the cells sequentially.)
