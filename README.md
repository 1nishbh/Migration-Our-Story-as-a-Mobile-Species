Migration seems to be ingrained in the blueprint of our existence. From the dawn of our species, humans have migrated from Africa to Asia to Eurasia to America. Early ancestors moved from places to places in search of better habitats and food. Migration not only ensured the survival of our species through suitable climate and food but also changed the behaviors and lifestyle of our species as a whole. The hunter-gatherers tribe settled into agricultural soci- eties, and there are several other revolutionary transformations to the structures of our society that can be ascribed to migrationâ€“rise and fall of kingdoms, industrial revolution, displace- ment of indigenous population, changes in the population characteristics (gender, religion, age groups), to mention some. While the nature of migration and its consequences have changed along with times, it is important that the patterns of migration are scrutinized to understand the socioeconomic drivers of migration. This project will study the mobility of human from different countries across two different decades, 2000-2010 and 2010-2020. As stated before, humans have always been mobile species, but the motives have evolved over time. So it will also be equally important to shed light on the driving forces of migration, rather than bluntly mentioning the statistics. In order to achieve this aim, this project will look migration patterns through the lenses of economy, war, epidemics, and human rights.
